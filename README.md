## Hi There! ✌

- My name is Lucas Meres and I'm currently in the 8th semester of Computer Science. 👩‍💻 <br>

- I've been involved in several projects throughout my studies, mainly focusing on low-level programming, such as C/C++. But lately, I have been using a lot of C# for game development projects in Unity, as my dream is to work in this field someday. 💡 <br>

- I also have experience with Python, as I've worked on some projects using it, although it is not my main preference. 🐍

- Don't really mind my photo though, I really like doggos. 🐕 <br>
